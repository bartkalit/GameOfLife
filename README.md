# GameOfLife

It's a simple implementation of a well known Conway's game of life written in C++ and Ui made with SFML library.
<br>
### Rules of Conway's Game of Life:
<ol>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

### Example structures:
